# Current functionality
* By default, reads in a list of contacts, provided as json files
* This list can be filtered by any of a contact's defined attributes (e.g.: first name, last name, phone number)
* Clicking on a user will display that user's details

# Future functionality
* Provide complete set of CRUD functionality (namely create, update, delete)
* Validation when creating and updating contacts
* Add pagination
* Sorting

# This application demonstrates
* The structure of an AngularJS application with read-only data
* Component based architecture, similar to Angular 2 applications
* Using AngulrJS with $resource in a factory to provide data to the application
* A filter used on model data
* Use of Bootstrap 3
